# Analysis of World Happiness Report 2019 using R

**Project Overview**

The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. The world is a rapidly changing place and happiness is something that everyone pursuits in the ever growing complicated world. The United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network has been publishing the World Happiness report since 2012. This first report presented the available global data on national happiness and reviewed related evidence from the emerging science of happiness, showing that the quality of people’s lives can be assessed by a variety of subjective well-being measures, collectively referred to then and in subsequent reports as “happiness.” Each report includes updated evaluations and a range of commissioned chapters on special topics digging deeper into the science of well-being, and on happiness in specific countries and regions. We will try to do an Exploratory Data Analysis of the 2019 World Happiness Report. It contains rankings of national happiness based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various life factors.

**Research Questions:**
Below are some questions we will expect to answer from our Analysis:

1.	What factors contribute most to happiness of the country?
2.	Which factor is the key contributor for happiness of a country?
3.	Which factor is the least contributor to happiness of a country?
4.	Which region / continent is the happiest?
5.	Are countries lying in a certain region happier than other regions?
6.	How do negative attributes like corruption and negative affect impact the happiness of the country?
